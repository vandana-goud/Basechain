# Basechain
# Blockchain Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple blockchain implementation in Python. It includes basic functionalities such as adding transactions, mining blocks, and validating the proof-of-work.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new cell.
3. Run the cell to see the blockchain in action.

## Code Explanation
- **Blockchain Class:** Manages the blockchain, handles transactions, and performs proof-of-work.
- **Transactions:** Added to the blockchain and linked to new blocks.
- **Proof of Work:** Simple consensus algorithm to validate blocks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
